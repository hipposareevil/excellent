I took an overnight moto trip out to Eastern Oregon.  I was going to do a few nights but thunderstorms were predicted for Friday so I shortened it to one night.  The weather and roads were perfect.  I tried out powershifting for the first time and it was fun to shift sans clutch - and having just watch the Indy MotoGP race I felt sporty.

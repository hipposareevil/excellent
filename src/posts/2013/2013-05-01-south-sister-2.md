<h2>Ski in</h2>

I went down to Bend to ski into and climb South Sister.  I had thoughts of camping on the summit but camping at the base and going up lighter sounded more appealing.  The road from Mt. Bachelor wasn't open yet so I brought my old cross country skis and tried remembering how to ski again.


The way in was half cleared so there was a fair amount of hiking on pavement but the skiing sections went really fast.  I see why people skin instead of hike.  I definitely need to get some good skis and practice. From the trailhead it was a fairly quick hike up to the flats and over to camp.  I got misdirected a few times but made good time.


<h2>Climb</h2>

I woke up at 2am so I could get to the top by sunrise.  It was uber cold, a little below 20, and all of my breath froze on the inside of the tent.  I set up my camera to take some shots of the climb while I was going up to hopefully make a nice timelapse, then headed up at 3am.  I got to the rim by 5am and over to the summit proper at 5:15.  It was cold enough that my thermometer stopped displaying numbers properly, but the last number was 16.  I stomped around waiting for the sun to creep up and once it hit the horizon I went back to camp as I was too cold.

<h2>Way out</h2>

After skiing the flats towards the trailhead it was mainly by hoof until I was in sight of Mt. Bachelor where I was able to ski a few miles to the car.

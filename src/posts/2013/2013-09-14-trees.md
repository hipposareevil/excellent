Ing and I took Sara and Mark down to the McKenzie River area to go climb and sleep in the trees. The forecast was kinda dodgy but we lucked out and got nice temps and no rain.  Our sleeping platforms were around 180 feet up, just shy of the 220 feet height of the tree.  We didn't have any wind so there was no rocking to lull us to sleep.  Mark and Sara were champs on the climb and even got to use the special orange bottles during the night.  In the morning we hooked up the gri-gris and slid down the ropes to the bottom - much faster than climbing up that night.  We wrapped it up with bigass breakfasts down the road.  Next time we'll plan on visiting the hot springs that is just over the next hill.

I just bought a <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/venganza/">T-Shirt</a> supporting the <a href="http://www.venganza.org/index.htm">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a>.  The <a href="http://www.venganza.org/index.htm">site</a> goes into how FSM is another alternative to the normal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design">Intelligent Design</a> (ID).  As I think ID is a crock, I want to support FSM.  FSM at least can explain our global warming as an <a href="http://www.venganza.org/piratesarecool4.jpg">inverse relationship</a> to the number of pirates.

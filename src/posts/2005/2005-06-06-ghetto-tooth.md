Last week I realized one of my molars was hurting me.  I was thinking it was a cavity or something - it hurt to eat french fries and drink beer at the same time.  Which is totally unacceptable.

So I rolled down to <a href="http://www.timberhilldental.com">my dentist</a> in Corvallis today.  And I have broken my molar by grinding my teeth at night.  It was a "virgin tooth" and it's rare to break one like this.   I'm getting a crown, nothing like <a href="http://bigfaceworm.blogspot.com/2005/06/bling-bling-baby.html">Trey</a> cos I don't want gold.

This blows.  Now I have to wear my nightguard.  Which if I had been wearing it before I wouldn't have gotten this damn crack in my tooth.

So I'm going to drink beer until my tooth is fixed.  Advil is bad for your stomach I think, so this is a better approach.

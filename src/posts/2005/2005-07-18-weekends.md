Two weekends ago I went up to north to hang out with my buddy Sara on the Olympic penninsula.  We did a little ride around Crescent Lake where we saw a bunch of kids jumping into the lake from a rock.  Crazy I think.  Sara was a tad sick but we had a good time relaxing in the trees.  I had a horrible time starting a fire that night and Sara showed me up the next morning with some paper towels.  So I'm off to Man School.

Last weekend I went up to Twin Lakes with Aimee and her dog.  It was a nice little hike and we had the upper lake all to ourselves.  I tried to take naps on the ground but the dog decided to shake off the water on me.  So I threw it into the lake.  Hahahha.

Then on Sunday Aimee, her buddy Kim, Scott and I headed up to Hood again and went to Salmon Bluff for some climbing.  We did a few climbs that ranged from 5.7 to 5.9.  Ok, one was rated a 5.3, but I call BS on that because it had a traverse and the rock moved when I touched it.

Anyoo, here are some pictures from those weekends.

Last night I took my lead test with Scott at the gym.  I went up first to get it over with. My hands have been weak the past while so I ended up falling off a juggie 2/3rds of the way up and launching Scott into the air.  On my way down I landed on him and turned upside down.  That was pretty cool, but it didn't get me the super green card.  Everyone at the gym said it was the coolest fall they had seen, so there's that.

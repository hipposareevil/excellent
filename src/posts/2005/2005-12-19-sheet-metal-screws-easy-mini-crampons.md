I've wanted to get crampon type deals for my shoes in case it gets icy - like last night.  I was going to get Yak Tracks but they looked hokey.  I read that you can put sheet metal screws into your shoes and still go running on ice and snow.  That seemed like an easy solution so I put in twenty screws in each shoe.

I tried them out last night and they were fine on the ice, I didn't slip once.  This morning I was going to run to work but after getting up to Division I realized it was just wet out, not icy, I went back home and drove in.

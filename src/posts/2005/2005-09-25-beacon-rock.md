On Friday night I climbed Beacon Rock in the Gorge with my friend Ben.  It was a 6 pitch climb, with the last being a 200 foot scramble.  We went up 3 pitches and then I lowered Ben back down to the ground on another route so he could top rope that (a 5.11).

After Ben's climb we continued up, now it was in the dark.  We used headlamps and it was pretty damn cool.  Ben lead the whole way and I just cleaned on the way up.  It was a little funky at parts when it was completely dark and you had to move your headlamp around to figure out the foot holds.

We made it to the walkway around 9:30 and after organizing a bit we hiked back down to the parking lot.  I went to get the car (and beer) while Ben got his bag from the backside of the rock.  When Ben got back there was a Ranger there and he came over and talked to us as apparently the park and parking lot were closed.  And he didn't seem to appreciate us having a celebratory beer in the close lot.  He didn't hassle us too much and we took off for the safe shore of Oregon.

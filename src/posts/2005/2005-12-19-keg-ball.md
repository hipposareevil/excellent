I've had the keg from my halloween party hanging out in the backyard, waiting for some attention.  On Saturday Ron came over to eat pizza and look at my broken window.  Instead of working on the window we broke out the 16lbs sledgehammer and went to town on the keg.

This is a different version of beer ball, which we did with the 2 half-racks of skunked beer.  With the beer cans you can toss them like a baseball and hit them with your broken shovel.  With keg ball you just beat the keg.

And there was ice from the backyard and pumpkins from halloween.  After we got tired of breaking open the keg, we put the ice and pumpkins on the keg and went after them.

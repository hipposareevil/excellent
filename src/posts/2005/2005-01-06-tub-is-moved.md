Last night my climbing buddies, Ron, my dad and I moved the tub into the back yard.  I was worried that it wouldn't make it back there, so the previous night Ron and I took my new 16 pound sledge hammer to the ground and made some more room.  After a few beers last night we all went outside, lifted the tub up and were done in 10 minutes.  This weekend I'm getting gravel and sand, then it's just the electricity and we're soaking.

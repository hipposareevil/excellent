Today I finished my first run, the <a href="http://www.nikerunhitwonder.com">Run Hit Wonder</a>.  It was a 10k, or 6.2 miles.  I was aiming for under an hour and I think I just sneaked in.
There were like 10,000 people, it was pretty cool to see the crowd as we ran down Salmon to the river.  I actually passed people, but then got passed myself quite a bit.  Turns out there are larger people than me who can run fast.  Who knew?

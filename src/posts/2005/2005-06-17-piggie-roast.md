I'm getting ready for my pig roast tomorrow.  Last night Dan and Kate came over and helped me dig the pit for the pig.  It's about 4 x 2 x 3 feet.  It felt like we were getting ready to bury someone, I guess we are going to bury Bessie (I know it's a Cow's name, but I don't discriminate.)

Today I ran out to Mt. Scott Fuel and bagged up 8 cubic feet of lava rock for the pit.  Who woulda known it'd be so heavy?

Tonight I'm picking up chicken wire (to get the pig out of the whole), some cloth (to cover the pig so it doesn't get dirty) and maybe some charcoal to start the fire going.

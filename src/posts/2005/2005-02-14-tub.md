So my tub hasn't been getting super hot as of late, or ever.  And the GFI breaker I put on the outside of the garage has been tripping a lot.  I had the repair guy come over.

And of course it's like when you take your car to the shop, it won't misbehave when the mechanic is around.  I couldn't get the tub to trip while he was there.  He tightened down all the wire screws and said that could be it.  And then he adjusted the thermostat so it'll get hot in the tub.  He warned that it might get too hot, like 110, if it's set to the max.  Which is fine with me.

As the GFI is still being tripped, I'm going to disconnect the bonding ground, as that might be doing it as well.  If that fails, I'm just going to get a non GFI breaker and throw that on the wall.  The tub comes with a GFI so everything should be ok.

And I picked up like a million bags of packing peanuts for insulation.  Turns out I really only need like 2 bags, so now I have a bunch of black garbage bags filled with crap that likes to float around and make my yard look even trashier.

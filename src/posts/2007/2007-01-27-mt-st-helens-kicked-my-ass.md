On Saturday Jamie invited me to go ski up and down Mt. St. Helens.  I went with him, Matt, Bob, Mark? and the Boarder (whose name I forgot).I had a list of excuses to turn around but thankfully didn't have to use them as around 5000' the wind got ridiclous and we all stopped there.As the wind didn't get better we headed down anyway after declaring 5000' the summit of St. Helens.

I made one successful turn and then fell on every turn after that.  My best was falling head down hill and then flipping over my head.So I took off the skiis and carried them down with my broken pole (from fall #8).

It was a frickin' gorgeous day and I think everyone had a good time.

On Saturday I went up to French's Dome with Keevin and Matt.  We did a few climbs and it was pretty good.  But the exciting part was there is a zip line there.  They're rebuilding the belay areas on the right side of the dome and have a cable line installed to move the timber.  So we thought it'd be a good idea for Keevin to do the zip line.  We did a few dry runs and then let him rip down.  He was on a rope clove hitched to a tree so he wouldn't hit any of the construction half way down the line.

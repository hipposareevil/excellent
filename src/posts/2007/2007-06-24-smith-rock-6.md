Over the weekend Ron and I went over to Smith to try and help out Vince's Boy Scout troop do some climbing.  We set up a few top ropes over by Cinammon Slab.  We did a few 5.8s and a 5.5.  After they left Ron and I redid the 5.8 to the side of Cinammon Slab and then did the 2nd pitch of 5.5.

The next day we ran over to Super Slab (5.6) after a bigass breakfast and had a bad ass time.  I think next time Ron will be ready to do his first real trad lead on the 3rd pitch - the money pitch.  When I lead it this time I was able to run out certain sections to practice going faster and it was totally bomber.

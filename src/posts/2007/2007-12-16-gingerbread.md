Ingrid put together a gingerbread house party for Kelly.  Sara, May, Matt and Kelly came over and we all watched as Kelly and Ingrid made dough.  May had a dope house, Sara made a cool shrunken head, Kelly and Ingrid made trees and skiis, Matt made an ice axe and I made a bowl that didn't come off the mold.

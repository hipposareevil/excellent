Over the weekend I went back to Providence for my 10 year reunion.  My friend Jon met gave me a lift to Newport where he's working and living with his wife Aliki and two girls.  I hung out there until Alex and Susa showed up and then after eating some fish & chips we went up to Brown.

We had campus dance Friday night after free beer at New Dorm where we ran into some old friends.  At the dance I saw Dustin Hoffman.  The next day we had breakfast at Brickway on Wickenden after walking by the old houses.  Molly, Nicole, Brian, Hilda, Paul and Sofia were at Brickway too.  After a nap I went over to the CIT for the Computer Science reunion and ran into a few people I remembered and profs who didn't remember us.

That night the 1997 class had a party behind the main green where I bumped into other people I hadn't seen in 10 years.  I saw Tim and we tried to work the word fuck into every sentance.  His wife was fucking nice enough to play along too.  After that we went down to <a href="http://www.waterfire.org/">Water Fire</a>, where they have fire on the rivers downtown.  I've always liked it and this time was no exception.  There was a living statue who was probably the most striking woman I'd seen in a long time.

Sunday was commencement and after some bagels with mayo and egg (as the Silver Truck is dead, damnit.)  After getting some lemon ice (like a slushy) we went back to the dorm and Alex and I played frisbee until he gave up admitting I was the better.

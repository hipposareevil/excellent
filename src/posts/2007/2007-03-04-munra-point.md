On Sunday I went to the gorge for a little hike with Kate, Cyndi and Matt.  We went up Munra point.  Well, I didn't make it all the way cos my shoes sucked and were sliding all over the place near the top.  Cyndi was nice enough to turn back with me as Kate and Matt went to the top a bit further.  It was a cool hike and looked like Mordor for a while.

On Sunday Ingrid and I went down to help out Trey, Mary and Simone make some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cob_(material)">cob</a> for a new fireplace.  It was pretty fun to much around w/ the mud and straw.  My bricks were the ugly strawie ones, while Miles and Ingrid made really nice ones.

On Monday, Ingrid, Ron and I went up Dog Mountain to get a bit of exercise and look at the flowers.  It was a bit slow going up but totally worth the views from up there.  You could see the top of Mt. Hood, Mt. St. Helens and Mt. Adams.  Up top were at least 30 people, and we must've run across another 30 on the ways up and down.  Ingrid and I talked to this older gal who was cool as hell, she trains with 2 gallons of water for the hike up.  I felt like a siss just carrying 5 gallons when I'm 40 years her junior.  She was badass.

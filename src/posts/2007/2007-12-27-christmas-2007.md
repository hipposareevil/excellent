For Christmas I went over to my parents and opened gifts and then ate too many cinnamon rolls.  That night Angel, Ron, Jami and John came over for dinner.  We had ham wrapped in bacon with garlic inside.  It was as good as last years.  The following weekend Trey, Mary and Simone came up to Portland and Ingrid and I went over to my parents to open more gifts for Simone and have lamb.  Ding got a new hat made by Mary.  He says he likes it, even though he's an ice bat his ears get cold.

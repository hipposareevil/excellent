After years of being let down by Crank Brothers Eggbeaters I have finally been broken by their failure.  I would always tout their awesome design and tell anyone who would listen how simple they are and therefore are bulletproof.  I broke a new pair in under 500 miles of easy riding, this time it was the 'simple' part of the pedal.  When I went to the garage for a replacement pair I saw the 5 boxes of used pedals that I have gone through.  That is beyond ridiculous and it's time to move on.

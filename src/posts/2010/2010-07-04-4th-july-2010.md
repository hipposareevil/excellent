We went down to the beach for the annual F-15 flyby, though this year there was a low ceiling and no flyover.  So we had to be content with the traditional parade where we get pelted with candy.  Simone wanted to be in the parade, she even had a special dress for the occasion.  She didn't forsee the repercussions of us getting very little candy when she wasn't standing by us.<br />
We did stood by other traditions and layzed around, grilled meat and took pictures of Simone.  Ingrid's mom, two brothers and girlfriend (she's Tom's girlfriend, not both of theirs girlfriend - that'd be weird) came down and hung out as well.  I rode the Triumph down as it was supposed to be nice out, instead I had my first experience riding in the rain.

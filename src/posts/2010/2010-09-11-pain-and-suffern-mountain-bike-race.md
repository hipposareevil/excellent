Ingrid rode the <a href="http://www.painandsuffern.com/">Pain and Suffern</a> mountain bike race in perfect weather.  The course was pretty difficult looking and they rode for 90 minutes over hayed fields, through hilly forest and back up again.  Ingrid came in first and got a medal and a free pair of glasses!  Very cool.

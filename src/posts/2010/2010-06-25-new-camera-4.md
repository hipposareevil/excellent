I got a new <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/1002/10022411pentaxoptiow90.asp">camera</a> as I broke my Canon while flailing around at Smith Rock.  Insurance is covering the camera to get it fixed, but in the meantime I need a smaller camera.  The new one is water/shock/cold/heat/dust proof, supposed to be at least.  It should do better in the cold for next years mountain attempts.  The macro lens works pretty well and it holds up to my strenous test of dunking in a pint glass of water.

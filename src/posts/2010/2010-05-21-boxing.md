Ingrid and I have been taking a boxing class under Berg at her <a href="http://wbfitness.com/">gym</a> for a few months now.  It's about the most fun you can have with a workout, many times better than yoga.  I've always thought my boxing was weak (when I did hapkido in college) and it's nice to get proper instruction.  About the only thing missing is actually hitting and getting hit.

Ron and I had planned on going to a motorcycle rally in Baker City this weekend.  The weather looked like bunk so I bailed and Ron went on his own Friday.  The weather turned around so Sunday I saddled up and rode out there for a look.  The roads were awesome as usual.  Ron and I hung out in the thriving town of Baker City and joked about Harleys and chaps.  On Monday we got up early and rolled back to Portland via John Day and Condon.  The riding was even better coming back.

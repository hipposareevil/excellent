Last night I was at the <a href="http://portlandrockgym.com">rock gym</a> getting in a climb on a 5.7.  Two thirds of the way up the route I was standing up on my right leg when the hold shattered and flew to the ground.  I'm glad my belayer wasn't directly below me.  After finishing the route and coming down the guy who made the route came by and brought a new hold.  I got to go up again and take out the old bolt and put in a new hold.  I didn't get to keep the broken hold, but I have a little shard that was remaining on the wall.

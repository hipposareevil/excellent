I started working on my house this weekend.  I was super ambitous and thought I'd get both rooms prepped and primed this weekend.  I tried this orange solvent to strip the paint off of the nasty window frame in the bedroom.  It seemed like it was working well, but turned out to be a pain in the ass to clean off.

On my 4th (of 6) trips to Home Depot I picked up a cleaning bit for Ron's cordless drill to take the paint and solvent off from the small spaces.  The brushes disintegrated within a few minutes and didn't get too much cleaning done.  I ended up taking out my big carbide scraper and taking all of the paint off with that.

My dad helped me fix the ceiling of the bedroom, there was some water damage and the plaster was coming off.  I used my new cold chisel to take the plaster down.  I then put up some gyp board and mudded it.

On Saturday I took the carpet and padding out of the room.  What was left was tack board along the walls and about 200 staples in the floor.  I thought to myself, "Hey, I can take staples out no problem."  The needle nose pliers couldn't get a grip on the staples, so I had to take a screwdriver and a rubber mallet to get them up a little.  Then I took the pliers and pulled the staples out.

My last project was to start taking the security bars off of the windows.  I'm using my buddy Vince's grinder for this job.  It seems to take about 3 minutes a bolt, not too bad.  I'm wearing a tanktop on my head to cover my neck and face from the spark showers that erupt from the grinder (which looks pretty cool.)  I got two windows cleared, just 8 more to go.

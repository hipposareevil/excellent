After picking up my ticket to Beijing and arranging for a hotel I went up to Victoria Peak by tram.  It was much easier than jogging up.  It was a bit touristy, with a Wax Museum and a Ripley's Believe It Or Not, but the ride up was worth the ticket.  We stopped at a platform on the way up and the tram bounced up and down with the stretch of the cable.

At top I had a small lunch of Singaporian Noodles (to get ready for down south) and a fruit shake.  I then walked around a bit and took in the sights before heading back downtown and home.

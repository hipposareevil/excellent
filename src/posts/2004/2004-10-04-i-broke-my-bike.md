I was gently riding my bike home on Thursday when I felt it shimmy, kinda like when you taco a wheel.  But I was just going on pavement so I figured it was a flat tire.  I pulled over and saw it wasn't flat.  But the rear wheel was a bit out of true and I spent 10 minutes truing it up on the sidewalk.

I hopped back on it for a test spin and it had the same shimmy.  I figured I got a flat this time.  No flat.  Then I saw the right side chain stay was sheared.  Not too much you can do about that.
I tried riding down the street but the wheel kept hitting the frame and it felt too funky.  And if the other stay flexed and broke then I'd be in a world of hurt.

I called everyone I could think of.  If I didn't call you it's because you need to get a truck or a bike rack.

It took me 20 minutes of limping the bike along to realize that we have a thing in Portland called buses.  And on these "buses" there are bike racks.  And they go right by my house.

So I walked down to Division and hopped on the # 4 bus.  I know people were thinking, "what a sack, he has on his little biking getup and still uses the bus."  Cos I would think that.

On Friday I brought my bike to Acme Welding on 7th and Salmon and they fixed it right up and now my bike is running fine.

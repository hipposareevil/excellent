Ron, Henry and I just got back from Moab this evening.  It was an awesome time, we had good rides and no one got hurt.  We rode Bartlett Slickrock, Monitor Merimack, Slickrock, the bottom of Porcupine Rim and Amasa Back.  My brakes wonked out on me again so I ditched them to get some mechanical Avid disc brakes and they work really well.   So I'll be trying to hock my other brakes after I get them warranteed.
It was Jeep Jamboree week and we got to see the thousands of Jeeps and other four wheeled monsters.  We hung out at Potato Salad to see if anyone would mess up their rigs, and came up flat.  But we got to watch as people threw their vehicles up the wall and get heckled by the crowd.  One guy in a Toyota was having a hard time getting up and got yelled at by a young girl "You want to use my winch!?!"  That was pretty damn funny.

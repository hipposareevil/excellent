I finally climbed a 5.11 at the <a href="http://www.portlandrockgym.com">gym</a> this week.  I did it clean on Sunday and then again yesterday after a few false starts.  In the bouldering area I even climbed a few V1s pretty easily.  When I started climbing I had trouble doing VBs (which are 2 lower than V1s) and could barely eek up a 5.7.

I ran into a buddy Ben at the gym after I was done.  A few months ago he asked if I wanted to climb <a href="http://www.parks.wa.gov/parkpage.asp?selectedpark=Beacon%20Rock&pageno=1">Beacon Rock</a>.  Then I didn't run into him and figured it wasn't going to pan out.  Last night he said "So, we gonna do Beacon Rock?"  Hell ye.  We're going to figure out when we can both go (maybe calling into work 'sick').  Should be pretty fun.

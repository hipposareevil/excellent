We got some rain last night and it froze all over the place.  Tonight on the way home from the bus I picked up the big chunks of ice and tossed them onto the ground to hear the large cracking sounds.  I'm sure people in their houses appreciated it.  I tried to take some pictures of the snow and stuff, but it's a little dark and I didn't remember my tripod, but here goes:

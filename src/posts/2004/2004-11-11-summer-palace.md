After sleeping in I went to the north west part of Beijing to catch a bus to the Summer Palace.  I was expecting a bus terminal but it was just like a normal town with bus stops along the streets.  I had to walk a little ways to find the bus stops, but couldn't find the number (375) that I wanted.  I used my fluent Mandarin to say hello and point at the number 375 and the Chinese for Summer Palace and got directions to the other side of the street.

I hopped on the bus and pointed in my book to the Summer Palace and the fare lady nodded her head.  I paid my 1.5 yuan and sat down for the ride.

I didn't end up getting to the Summer Palace until 12:30 and it closed at 5.  I was a bit worried that I wouldn't see everything I wanted to in such a short time (everyone says you need a full day.)  But it got to be pretty cold and windy so I didn't think I'd be itching to sit around and do people watching.  I was still a bit bummed from leaving my jacket in Hong Kong - who woulda known that it was super cold and windy?  Everyone else had on nice North Face parkas and wool jackets. :(

I walked around and looked at the various halls and walkways.  It was nice to not hear the city (until you get to the top of the hill.)  I can see why royalty hung out here, it has a beautiful lake and neat looking palaces.  They have a bunch of large stones or rocks that have much significance.  They look like large pieces of coral and seem really alien to the place.


There was a long walkway called the Long Corridor.  It is a half mile long covered walkway with rotundus every 200 feet or so.  Every 15 feet is a support beam that is painted with a scene from a lake or a mountain.  It was pretty neat looking.

As I was super cold I decided to leave and wait in the wind for the bus to go back to town.  Not sure why I didn't take a taxi.  But I vowed to get a jacket before going to the Great Wall.

After finding out that you had to wave down the bus, I rode back into town to find the underground.  I found out that there are multiple metro lines in Beijing, and I almost took one that went waaay to the North.  I went across the street to the one I really needed.

I got out at my first hotel and walked to the same restaurant I went to on Tuesday night.  I got a different pork dish and a plate of dumplings again.  I took a picture of it this time because it was so much food.  I didn't even finish it all.

To work off a bit of the dinner, I walked back to Tianemmen Square to find myself a jacket.  I saw a store that was selling a North Face jacket, but I knew it'd be fake and I already have a rain coat - in Hong Kong.  I went into a jacket store and tried on a few black coats.  I thought they'd be pretty spendy, but the lady entered 190 yuan on a calculator.  Which was like $25.  Not too bad.  I tried on a few different jackets until I found one that fit ok.  She entered 185 on the calculator and I used my master bargaining skills and got it for 180.  Woo hoo!  Whatever, it's warm and I was super cold.  I don't know if it'll last many years or anything, but it looks pretty good and has two layers.

I'm getting a different hostel tomorrow (hopefully) and heading out to one of the Great Walls for the afternoon.  And then I'm planning on getting a massage and going to see the Chinese acrobats perform.

Alex, my buddy from <a href="http://www.brown.edu">Brown</a>, came out from Chicago last Wed. to hang out for the weekend.  His wife Susa flew out Friday afternoon too.  I took them <a href="http://portlandrockgym.com">rock climbing</a> and to Stanich's (the best place for burgers in portland), and finally to the beach.

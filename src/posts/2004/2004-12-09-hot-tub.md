Last night I drove up to Vancouver to look at a hot tub that a guy on <a href="http://portland.craigslist.org">craigslist</a> was selling.  I had measured the passage between my house and the garage and it was 38" wide and 7' tall.  When I saw the tub I measured it and it was 37" wide and just under 7' long.

The owner showed me what had to be fixed - the heater element and a little bit of piping.  It looks pretty doable, especially if I can snag someone to do it for me.

It's being delivered on Saturday morning and if I get in gear I could have it up and running in a week or two.

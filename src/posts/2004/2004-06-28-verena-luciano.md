We were in Moab a few years ago (I believe it was Moab IV) and there was a slideshow being given by a couple who were traveling the world by bike.  It was an amazing show and they seemed pretty cool.  They have a website that is over in Japan that hosts <a href="http://y-field.com/veraluc/bicycle/countries/c_frame.html">their pictures</a>.

You should check it out - the <a href="http://y-field.com/veraluc/bicycle/countries/bolivia.html">Bolivia</a> and <a href="http://y-field.com/veraluc/bicycle/countries/argentina.html">Argentina</a> pages have some awesome pictures.

I don't know about you, but it makes me want to get some dinero together and head out for a long ride.

My house closed last Wednesday as I was sitting in Ron's truck on I-84 in Utah.  Now I can get excited about buying picture molding hooks.

I started my move last night by taking over a bottle of Vodka and Southern Comfort.  I looked throughout the house and saw how much cleaning I'll be doing over the next few weeks. Fun stuff.

The refrigerator is standing in front of the hallway door, so I think it's about time to get a sub-zero undercounter unit.  I think the first thing I need is a <a href="http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?storeId=8000&catalogId=40000008000&productId=2518868&parent_category_rn=4500749">pull up bar</a>.  Gotta have priorities.

On Saturday Moo, Gerry and I met up with their friends Jake and Pat for a trip out to Lamma Island (south of HK.)  We took a fast ferry to Yung Shue Wan to start our walk to Sok Kwu Wan on the south side of the island.  We stopped for a snack, little dumplings and sweet bean curd.

The walk went through the Yug Shue Wan village, by a jungle (in my book), a beach and over a little mountain range.  We got to see the lovely strip coal mine when we were by the beach.  There was a sign warning people to stay out of the water because the shark net wasn't working.

On the other side of the hill we saw the fish farms in Sok Kwu Wan bay.  We walked by small tunnels that were bored into the side of the mountain by the Japanses in WWII to be used in surprise attacks on the Allies.

In the village there were tens of restaurants, and only one was busy, Rainbow Restaurant.  We plopped our things down there and looked at the tanks of sea creatures, picking out which we wanted to eat.  Well, I didn't pick any, I wasn't sure what some of them were.  Except for the largest prawns I've ever seen, at least 4 inches long.

Lunch consisted of many courses of different sea foods; prawn, long clams, garlic scallops, crayfish, shrimp fried rice and century eggs.  I tried the century egg and have to say it wasn't too bad, but I don't think I'll be going out for more of them.  The scallops were pretty amazing, very fresh and flaky like real meat.  The crayfish was awesome too.

After stuffing ourselves we took the Rainbow Restaurant's boat back to Hong Kong.  Jake and May went home and we went to Moo's work to pick up some mail.  He works on the 65th floor and has a great view of downtown Hong Kong.  Here is a picture from his office of Victoria Peak (where I'm going tomorrow.)

I've been slowly moving stuff into my house, I had just a couch for about a week and then last weekend my parents brought back my futon from the beach house.  Yesterday I came back from the beach with my futon frame so I have a real bed and am not just sleeping on the floor.  Then my parents brought over 2 tables and some chairs I had left at their place - it's like I have a real house now!

Well, it's complete now because I put up my new <a href="http://www.metoliusclimbing.com/simulator.htm">training board</a> above my hallway door.  Hopefully it's screwed into the header correctly and I won't pull it down when I'm working on it.  It has over 15 different holds and I can actually use about 4 of them, so I have a lot of room for improvement.

My neighbor lady who was so happy about my lawn finally being worked on went to the big garden in the sky on Sunday.  I was outside (working in the yard) when I saw two people wheeling out a body bag.  A man came over and told me that she had passed the previous night.  Turns out she wasn't doing so well lately and it was just her time.  When I saw her last she was pretty sprite and energetic.  I'm glad that she at least got to see her neighbor's yard not look like a scene out of Africa.

Last night I told my neighbor across the street about the neighbor lady.

"Kinda strange to have someone die right next to you," I said.

"Shit, that's a shame," he responded.  "Guess everyone is getting out of this neighborhood."

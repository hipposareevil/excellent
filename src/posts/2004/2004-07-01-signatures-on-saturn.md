The Cassini probe just reached Saturn this week, and along with sensors and along with <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/huygens-probe.cfm">the Huygens probe</a> a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/07/01/signature.cassini.ap.ap/index.html">DVD of signatures</a> was sent.  Why is this cool?  Cos my signature is on that puppy!  I'm one of 600,000+!  (And my forged signature of my buddy Sara's too.)

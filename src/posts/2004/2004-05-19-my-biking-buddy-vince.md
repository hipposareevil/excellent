Everyone who goes biking should have a biking partner like mine.  He just called to confirm that we were in fact going riding today after work.  The last 2 weeks he's had to bail for lame reaons like "My son is shipping off to Iraq tomorrow and this is the only night he's in town."  Whatever -- I don't see the commitment.

He said today, "Look, I haven't ridden in a while, so we're going to be moving slow."  I pointed out that we always have equipment failure and that's a good reason to turn around.  He laughed, "Well, I brought my knife so I can have an 'accidental tire blowout' and we can go drink beer."  <em>That's</em> what I'm talking about, willing to sacrifice the bike to get some beer.

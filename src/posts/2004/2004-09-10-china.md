I just bought my ticket to China for my buddy <a href="http://www.gerryandjason.com/">Moo's wedding</a>.  I'm going to Hong Kong for a week to hang out with Moo and see the boats, then train it up to Beijing for a week to see the little fence.  Then it's down to Singapore for a few days of food and wedding.  Turns out that it's going to be cold in Beijing (with lows of freezing), which is funny because I'll be in Singapore where it's hot (with lows of 75 degrees) a few days later.

Yesterday I made an offer on a house on 10th and Failing.  There were 3 other offers as of yesterday and the owner was reviewing them last night.  I was hoping to hear back last night, but haven't heard anything yet.  So I'll have to wait today and if nothing comes back I'll assume someone plopped down a larger offer.

Well, the house didn't come through so I'm gonna have to keep looking.  Someone must've way outbid me, and I had offered over $5000 more than the list. jeesh.

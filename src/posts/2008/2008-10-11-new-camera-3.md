I got a new <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Digital-SLR/25446/D90.html">camera</a> on Friday.  I was trying out my dad's camera and decided I needed a SLR myself.  I went up to Washington Park on Saturday to hike around <a href="http://www.hoytarboretum.org/">Hoyt Arboretum</a> to try out the camera and get in a little walk.

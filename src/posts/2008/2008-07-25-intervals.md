I started doing intervals two times a week.  It's completely horrid.  I just snagged two intervals to do from <a href="http://www2.trainingbible.com/joesblog/blog.html">Joe Friel</a>'s blog.  I was planning on doing this for 3 weeks total and then switch over to different types of intervals.

Wednesday is a 5 sets of 3 minute sprint/3 minute recovery.  Friday is 3 sets of 5 reps of 20 second sprint/ 40 second recovery.  This is one set of 3x20/40.

Ingrid and I went to the <a href="http://www.jackjohnsonmusic.com">Jack Johnson </a> concert with JT and Anne.  It was way over in St. Helens in some grass fields and we lucked out to have no rain.  Ingrid had run into Jack on the MAX and he called her out inbetween songs. We screamed like idiots to get him to bring her up on stage, but he took off his shoes instead.

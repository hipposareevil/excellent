We went to the <a href="http://portlandrockgym.com/main.html">PRG</a>  Ice Festival to watch Keevin compete.  He came in 2nd in the first round, tied in the 2nd and was the only one to finish the route in the 3rd.  So he's the champion.   Check out the <a href="http://vimeo.com/1864373">video of the finish of the 2nd round</a>

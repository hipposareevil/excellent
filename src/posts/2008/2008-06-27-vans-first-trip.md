Ingrid and I went up to Mt. Hood in the van's first trip.  We went first to some crappy state campground, but it was uber iffy looking, so we continued up to Sherwood Campground a little further south.  It was a really nice campground and we hung out there two days.  We went biking on Saturday along the East fork of the Hood river.  The ride was easy and pretty short as the upper part was washed out.

The van worked out really well for camping.  It was nice to just pull over, pop the top and go to sleep.  We even rigged up a shower curtain so we could use the solar shower after biking.

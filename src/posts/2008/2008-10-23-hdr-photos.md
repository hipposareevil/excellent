I've seen articles and pictures concerning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging">HDR</a>, but thought it was all just a hack.  The more I thought about it, the more I thought it was performing the duty of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodging_and_burning">dodging and burning</a>.  It really just modifies the picture to show the detail in the darker and lighter areas of the picture at the same time.

So I downloaded a few programs and tried <a href="http://www.hdrsoft.com/index.html">one</a> out.  I'm still learning my new camera, but I set it up to bracket the shots and took 3 pictures in the back yard.  I think I exposed two pictures above normal, as opposed to doing one photo under exposed, one normal and one over exposed.  But the result is still pretty cool.

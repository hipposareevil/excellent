On Saturday, Ingrid and I went up to Olympia to check out an '85 VW Westfalia Weekender.  It looked pretty solid with a newly rebuilt engine and a few issues that come with 20 year old cars. We got the Weekender as it doesn't have the kitchen sink and such, as we don't see ourselves cooking that much and it'd be nice to have the extra room instead.  It's a pretty nice rig and actually goes freeway speeds.  It's going to the shop for a few days to get things touched up.  I just ordered a new poptop tent and hangers for the curtains that are being dry cleaned.  We also got a new futon ordered to replace the old bed in back.

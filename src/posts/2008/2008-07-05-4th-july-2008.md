We went down to Gearhart for the 4th again.  The rest of the family was there and Trey made some carmel corn with peanut butter.  A sure sign the diet was on hold.  The parade wasn't as exciting as last year, but that's because we didn't get any candy.  The F-15 flyover was cool though, it was about 150' above us as it did a few banked turns.  So maybe the parade was more exciting than last year.

We went down to the ocean to look at the fireworks and the fires.  We decided to leave when one group fired their fireworks into the grasses near the beach.  Next time I'll have to bring the tripod down so shots aren't so hazy looking.

I got a tattoo.

Trey had told me about a race a few years ago from Government Camp to Timberline Lodge.  The fastest time was 25 minutes, which is impressive given it's around 2,000' gain over 6 miles.  I was aiming for 45-60 minutes.  I ended up getting 39 minutes which I thought was pretty good.  I found out later that I didn't do the same route as them, so I'll be redoing this soon.  The monitor showed me as having over 180bpm on the way down, but that was just a misread.

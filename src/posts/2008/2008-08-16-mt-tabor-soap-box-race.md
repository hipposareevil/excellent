On Saturday we went up to Mt. Tabor to check out the <a href="http://pdxpipeline.wordpress.com/2008/08/05/august-16-portland-adult-soapbox-derby-mt-tabor-park/">Soapbox Derby</a>.  The soapboxes were really cool and made us want to do it next year.  I see us watching it again instead.  I just picked up a new/used <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0508/05082302pentax_optios60.asp">camera</a> and here are it's first pics.  It's not quite as fast or clear as the Canon cameras, but for $25 it's a good price and will do well for climbing.

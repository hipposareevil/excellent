Last Wednesday I tweaked my back running stairs at lunch.  I thought it was pretty dumb to hurt yourself running up stairs so I didn't do anything about it until this week.  I went back to PT and got checked out.
PT gal said my pelvis was out of alignment from all of the left turns, and she pulled my leg to get it back straight(ish).  The pain in my back kinda went away and turned into a leg pain, which she attributed to the inflamed muscles pushing on the nerves.  So that's cool.

On Monday I go to a Doctor to hopefully get some anti inflamatory medicine so I don't have to take my gangster walk down to Mexico.

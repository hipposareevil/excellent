Trey and I had plan to camp on summit of Mt. Adams, like South Sister last month. Our fitness told us it was not to be. Dan caught up to us at Lunch Counter (9300'). We made camp and slept in warm tent and bags. 

Next day was normal trudge up the south side. We put rocks in Dan's pack and hoped for the best. I raced him at the top and just threw up a lung onto the snow. The down is alway awesome. Wrapped it up with burgers and shakes at the cafe.

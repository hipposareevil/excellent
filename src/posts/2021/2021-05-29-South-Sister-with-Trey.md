Trey and I trudged up South Sister to bivy on the summit.  We got there way past dark and it was chilly as I saved 6oz by leaving the tent fly in the car. I might've burned a hole in my sock trying to dry it out, so I stole Trey's socks for the next day.  The summit sunrise was spectacular as expected and requested.

description: "Hike up Mt. Fishtail in clouds"

Hike up Fishtail with Craig. Was super nauseated from the gila monster venom, had to stop quite frew times and even threw up near the top. We stopped at the hut as I felt like poo and it was cloudy. Which means we will have to go back to hit the actual summit.  The river at the end was nice to soak in.

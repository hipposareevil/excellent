On Thursday night I wanted to hike Angels Rest in the gorge and went up with Karen and Matt.  It was uber windy and once we got to the top we had to walk on fours and crawl from rock to rock.  We figured the gusts were near 45mph (with nothing to guide us besides being pushed over.)  After some Cheezits and hot cocoa we headed back down.

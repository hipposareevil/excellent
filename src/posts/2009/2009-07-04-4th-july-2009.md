For the 4th of July we all went down to Gearhart to play with the dogs and snag candy in the parade.  I rode down on the moto for my first freeway drive, which was on the scary side.  Ingrid and her mom came down on Friday with the dogs.  They got along with Simone's dog Hazel after a break in period.  We all went to sleep before the fireworks started as we are old.

I'm reading about strength building in  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Alpinism-Climbing-Light-Fast/dp/0898866545/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232692089&sr=8-2">Extreme Alpinism</a> by Mark Twight.  His book says (if I read it right) that you need to get warmed up and then do 6 sets of 2 reps of your almost max.  This is supposed to increase your neuromuscular pathways and in turn increase your strength but not mass.

It takes 9 or so sets of warming up before the set of 6, for a total of 15 sets. As you need to rest the muscles inbetween sets I tried throwing in other lifts or exercises.  It also takes close to 1 1/2 hours to get through the lifting.  I'm focusing on biceps and lats as I'm not wanting to hurt my shoulder with bench.  I'm not doing legs as the gym doesn't have enough weight to do low rep/high weight for legs (serious, I plate the press machine with 1 leg.)

This is my second workout like this, but I think I've seen a change already. In the first one I could barely get out 2 curls of 95lbs, but this time I got in 6 sets of 105.  Hopefully it's not a fluke and continues.

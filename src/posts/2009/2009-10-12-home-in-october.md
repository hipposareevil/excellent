Rocky decided to roll around in composted animal scat so we washed him twice.  I was mean and washed him outside in the cold and rubbed the shampoo in with ice.  Ingrid did the second clean with warm water - no wonder he yaps at me.  After losing a tug-of-war match with Tabitha I went outside and scared myself with a new dado blade while making a new bookshelf.

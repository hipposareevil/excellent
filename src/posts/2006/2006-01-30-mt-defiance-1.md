In preparation for climbing mountains this year, Matt, his friend Dobson and I went up into the Gorge to hike Mt. Defiance after eating some kickass breakfast burritos.  We ran into two other groups getting ready and they had snowshoes on their packs.  Matt hoped that they were over prepared.

Turns out we were under prepared.  At around 3000 feet the snow was about 5 feet deep.  It was fun to post-hole through it for a few miles, but then it got a little tiring so we ended up turning around a mile or so from the end.  We don't really know cos it was cloudy and we've never done it before.  But it was a hell of a lot of fun and we're ready to go up again this Sunday before SuperBowl.

On Tuesday I took my lead test, again.  This time they were kind enough to pass me.  After I finished the belay portion of the test and was told to be careful who belays me (as everyone is a midget), they handed me and Matt two cold beers.  Matt happens to be the only person in Portland who doesn't drink beer, so he gave it to Scott, who is smart enough to drink beer.  That was probably better than passing, drinking beer in front of everyone at the gym.

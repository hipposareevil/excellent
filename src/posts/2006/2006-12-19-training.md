I just started my training for spring's climbing season.  I decided to stop running (a while ago) as it kills my heel and didn't help hiking anyway.  So I've been doing stairs at my work with a pack full of kitty litter (40lbs) and rice (15lbs) and magazines (5ish).  According to the scale at work it weighs in at 75lbs.

I was going up and down the stairs but switched to taking the elevator down from the 9th floor.  I've been doing 60-70 flights and am aiming for 100 now that I'm using the elevator

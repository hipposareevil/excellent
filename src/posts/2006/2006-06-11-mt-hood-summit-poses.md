Esther, Keevin, Matt and I went up Hood Friday night via the West Crater Rim route.  We left Timberline Lodge a bit after midnight and hit the true summit around 7.  The conditions were perfect, freezing temperatures, solid snow, a cloud layer just below Timberline, a sky full of stars and a full moon such that we didn't need our headlamps.

We roped up just below Crater Rock until the summit.  I led, which meant everyone had to wait for me so there wouldn't be too much slack in the rope.  It was a totally bomber route and we all had a kick ass time.  We stopped for the sunrise and to grab some grub and water and got to see the shadow of Hood in the distance.  On summit we continued our road to perfection of Summit Poses, as you can see below.

I have to say this weekend blew.  We went for our training hike up Mt. Defiance and I was so tired I was resting on trees on the way up.  Matt and Keevin had to wait a half hour at the bottom I was so slow.<br />
On the drive home I wanted to get to my hot tub, so I drove a little faster than usual.  I saw the police lights behind me and thought "Hah!  Some asshole is getting pulled over."  Oh wait, he's following me into the other lane.  <emphasis>I'm</emphasis> the asshole.  $427 ticket.


That night Keevin and I watched Aliens in the tub until we were like Jello.  In the morning I got ready to go out and rent some more 24, cos like you, I like to watch Jack Bauer kick some ass.  I go out my door and notice my car locks are up.  "That'd be funny if my car was broken into" I thought to myself.
I got to the door and saw the broken window.  Not so funny.  They cracked my dash ripping out the stereo (the one night I didn't bring in the faceplate), stole the amps, bent the window trim, and lastly - stole my backup milkshake money from the glove box.

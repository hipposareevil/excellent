Today Matt, Keevin and I went up to Timberline Lodge to get in a little hike at altitude and practiceour basic snow technique.  We went above Palmer almost to Illumation Rock, but it was blowing snow pretty hard, so we took off back down.  We spent about 2 hours practicing self arrest, belaying on the snow and catching each others falls on rope.  It was a pretty kick ass time.

As you can see from the pictures it got rough up there and Keevin had to save Matt on the 70 deg slope.  But he got him, so don't fret.

I just received my first bit of trad gear today.  I've been wanting to do trad climbing (where you place your own protection) for a year now, but never got around to buying gear or going out and practicing.  This weekend we're heading over to <a href="http://smithrock.com/">Smith Rocks</a> for a friend's birthday so I will get my chance.  I'm hoping that for the Moab trip in 2 weeks I'll be able to lead up some easy stuff with Ron.

I don't have a full rack, or even a partial rack, in fact this is pretty pathetic, but it's a start.  I also bought a set of Black Diamond stoppers earlier at REI.  I even have a few <a href="http://www.yatesgear.com/climbing/screamer/index.htm">Yates Screamers</a> for sketchy placement.

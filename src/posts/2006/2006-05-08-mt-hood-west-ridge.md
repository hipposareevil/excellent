Saturday morning my friends Keevin, Frank and I went up Mt. Hood from Timberline Lodge.  We left around 2 am and hit the base of the Hog's Back around 5:30.  We decided to skip the Hog's Back and traverse over to the West Ridge.

I was a little freaked cos I hadn't done anything like that, but once we started it was totally bomber.  We did a running belay with snow pickets every rope length.

It was totally bad ass and here are some pictures.

For the Labor Day weekend Ron, Angel and I went up the South East corner of Beacon Rock.  I thought we'd fly up it as I now know the route, but it actually took us like 8 hours.  Good thing we brought a lot of water and grub this time.  At top a few hikers thought we were kickass as we had come up the 'face'.  We lucked out with weather as it wasn't too hot and had a nice breeze.

Over the weekend I went down to the beach with Sheri to take some photos.  Although we didn't have the light we wanted we took quite a few pictures and got comfortable taking shots.  After Sheri left to go surfing my friend Jill came down and with her came the sun.  We spent our time looking at Jill's recent travel pictures and eating Spanish tortilla.  I took entirely too many pictures of Jill's sandals at the beach on Saturday night.

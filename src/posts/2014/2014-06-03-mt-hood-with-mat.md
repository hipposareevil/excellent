Mat and I attempted Hood and fully expected to crush it.  I think Wy'east heard our bravado and slapped us down pretty hard.  It was probably a combination of sleep deprivation and fumerals but we topped out at just below the hogsback.  It was slightly depressing to turn around fairly close to the end, but we were moving too slow and I took Mat's pack and threw it down the hill to seal the deal.  We did get in a few good turns on the icy slopes of the Palmer.

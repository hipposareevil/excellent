We went to [Quinneys Bush](https://www.quinneysbush.co.nz/) after New Years to camp for a few days. It's a huge campground and has a swimming hole with slide, a huge flying fox (zipline), another huge water slide, and lots of biking for littles. Oscar had a great time running around and keeping in touch with us on our walkie talkies.  Many kids came to know Burton and sit with us while he got much attention.

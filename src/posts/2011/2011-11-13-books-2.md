I have been working on various incarnations of a page for listing my books for a few years now.  It started off as a way for me to see what books I had so I wouldn't buy double, so it was a .wml page as my first phones were old.  It eventually got to be a page that was only usable by me as a result of horrible design. One weekend I even spent both days scanning the covers for each of my books so I could show the covers.  (That set of photos is lost in the ether.)

I just revamped the <a href="http://willprogramforfood.com/books/">books</a> page to be searchable by author or title.  The author page has two views of the books, the traditional list and a <a href="http://www.jacksasylum.eu/ContentFlow/">coverflow</a> view, with a icon to switch between the two.  Hopefully it's intuitive enough.

I used a few web services to cobble together images; <a href="http://books.google.com">books.google.com</a> for book covers, and <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page">wikipedia</a> for author photos (which sometimes is the wrong person.)

Plus now the <a href="http://willprogramforfood.com/books">books link</a> is up top next to <a href="http://willprogramforfood.com/photos">photos link</a>

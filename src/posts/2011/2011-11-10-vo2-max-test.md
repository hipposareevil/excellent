Last February I took a EKG stress test to get a baseline of my heart for future.  It used the <a href="http://www.brianmac.co.uk/bruce.htm">Bruce Protocol</a> as part of the assesment, which extrapolated to a VO2 max number of 48.5.  

Yesterday I went and took a proper VO2 max test at <a href="http://bridgetownpt.com/blog/cardiocoach-vo2-max-testing.html">Bridgetown PT</a>.  The test consisted of running on treadmill with a mask and hose strapped to your face and a heart rate monitor.  The test itself took ~15 minutes, starting at 4mph ramping up to 10mph.  I ended up with a peak VO2 of 52.6 ml/kg/min.


Besides the VO2 number, I also got my Aerobic and Anaerobic numbers.  My Anaerobic Threshold is only 157, so there is more work to be done.
